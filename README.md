# HANSsolver.jl
HANS Solver is a toolbox for finding stationary equilibria of heterogeneous agents with discrete choice models. **HANS** stands for **H**eterogeneous **A**gents with **N**oncontinous **S**trategy.

The use is straightforward:

```
] add https://github.com/neoabs/HANSsolver.jl
using HANSsolver
```

There might be some warnings during compilation: these should be ignored I might address them in the near future. 

I uploaded [the algorithm description in pdf format](https://github.com/neoabs/HANSsolver.jl/blob/master/WP_technical.pdf). See it if need more deep insight into workings of this toolbox. *Take note that after pdf was generated some vital changes were submited to solver so solution times in document might be affected.*

In [the folder "example"](https://github.com/neoabs/HANSsolver.jl/tree/master/example) an instance of `ModelInit` is implemented. On it's own Model does not makes snece (might change in the future) but it can be used as a reference point how to use HANS Solver.

# TODO List

Since it is the first public release of the toolbox, many things are not yet perfectly polished while some functionalities are missing. If someone wants to help → let me know.

* **Allign naming convention with the one in PDF document**. This does not affects functionality of HANS Solver, however naming convention in PDF is more Julia-like.
* **Add GPU computing support**. In the past I tried using `ArrayFire.jl` but it turned out to lack some functionalities I needed. I tried `AMDGPU.jl` but could not install ROCm on my distro. I recently switched to xUbuntu so if I find some spare time I might try that.
* **Dynamic griding**. Genrally something that would remove grid points that are not used by agents and move them to area where `Ψ` is positive. 
* **TODO from the example**. I realized that there is a need for user to define an custom object after _Prices_ are updated and _Additional Prices_ are calculated.
* **Upgrade example**. Implementing economically sound model + adding Model description in PDF would do.
* **Implement Druedahl [2020] and Druedahl and Jørgensen [2017] algorithms**. This method is not compatible with multi-threading in it's raw form BUT with few tricks it might work.

# Thanks

The development of HANS Solver and corresponding research is financed by National Science Centre, Poland. A project id: 2018/29/N/HS4/01225.
Also great thanks to [Patrick Kofod Mogensen](https://github.com/pkofod) for advice and help.
